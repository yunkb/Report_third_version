\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
It is a memorable experience working in Power System Laboratory (PSL) at ETHZ from $26^{th}$ February to $26^{th}$ August in 2018. Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Dr. Gabriela Hug for providing me the chances to work in her group. Then, I would like to express my heartiest appreciation to my master thesis supervisor Thierry Zufferey for offering me the valuable time and fruitful guidance during these 6 months. I am also very thankful to Dr. Valverde Gustavo for his power flow calculation code and valuable ideas throughout the thesis. Finally, I am very grateful for working with the people in PSL and my friends in the lab who help me a lot during these 6 months.
